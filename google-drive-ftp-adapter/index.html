	<h3>Project info</h3>
	<p>This application lets you connect your FTP applications to your
		Google Drive files through the FTP protocol rather than using the
		Official's Google Drive client.</p>

	<p>This custom google drive client was created because official's
		one can't be reinstalled in a new PC without having to redownload all
		your drive files again, from the cloud to your local PC. So if you
		have hundred of Gigas and a regular ADSL it would take weeks to
		complete. Also, because the official client does not support FAT32
		partitions and I used to have all my files in one of this partitions.
	</p>

	<p>So this application basically starts a FTP server in your local
		machine emulating that it is hosting your google drive files, acting
		as a gateway. Once this setup is done, you can connect any FTP client
		to connect to your google drive files. I use it in conjunction with
		Beyond compare to compare my local files (stored anywhere in my cloud
		;) and compare them to ones I have in the google drive cloud.</p>

	<p>You are free to use this program while you keep this file and
		the authoring comments in the code. Any comments and suggestions are
		welcome.</p>
